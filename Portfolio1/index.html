                            After his wife, Ellie, passes away, Carl finds himself living alone in a house surrounded by encroaching urban development. 
                            Determined to fulfill his and Ellie's lifelong dream of exploring Paradise Falls, 
                            a remote location in South America, Carl decides to use thousands of helium balloons to lift his house into the sky.
